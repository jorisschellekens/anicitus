This repository consists of two parts, each with a different license:

* AGPLv3: software to create a deck of Cards against Humanity cards
* CC BY-NC-SA 4.0: the questions and answers used to create cards. That
  means you can use, remix, and share the cards for free, but you can't sell
  them without permission.
